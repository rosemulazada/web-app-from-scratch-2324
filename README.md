# The assignment

## Part 1: The Personal Website

My personal site is deployed on Github Pages and can be accessed here:
https://rosemulazada.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-2324/

Here I will be discussing the how's and what's of the project. For detailed information about the actual process, please see my Wiki at the top of this page.

## Introduction

We're kicking off the subject of Web Apps from Scratch on February 5th, and we're doing it with a personal website that should hold a JSON file with information about yourself and should receive data from an API. This data must be then collected in the second part of this assignment, the team application, in which the collective data of four sites is gathered to make a new website, for the teachers who can then take the students team apps and create something using that data. It's definitely curious and I'm excited to see how it will end up going! For now, let's start at the basics.

## Installation

Here are the steps to install my project.

1. Under the `Code` tab at the top (the big green button).
2. Download this repository as a `.zip` file and unpack it.
3. Locate the folder `web-app-from-scratch-2324.`
   - If you have `VS Code`: From here, all you need to do is open the folder in your editor and use the `Live Server` extension to start a local host. This allows you to also view the code and work more hands-on, should you desire.
   - If not, you can find the document on your device, navigate to the `index.html` file (this should be visible just by opening up `web-app-from-scratch-2324`), right-click it and open in a browser of your choosing: I can recommend Google Chrome, as this is the browser I've used personally.

## Usage and features

This project is mainly meant as an experiment of sorts; we pull data from our JSON file and an API, then, in turn, we pull that data from each of the members to our team app, and the teachers then pull all our team app data to one application for the entire class. Pretty cool.

This personal site had to be all about us; so, essentially, you can use it to get to know me a little..! Or as a base for a fun, interactive code. That also works.

The 'star of the show' in that regard would certainly be the last page, in my own opinion, where you have to turn the cards to reveal dynamic data.

It's features are as follows:

- Drag feature
- CSS Transitions
- Popup dialogue boxes
- Cards that you can actually turn
- Dynamic page loading
- **Dynamic HTML content (images/text) (API and JSON FILE)**
