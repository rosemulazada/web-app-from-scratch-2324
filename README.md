# The assignment

## Part 1: The Personal Website

My personal site is deployed on Github Pages and can be accessed here:
https://rosemulazada.github.io/web-app-from-scratch-2324/

Here I will be discussing the how's and what's of the project. For detailed information about the actual process, please see my Wiki at the top of this page.

## Introduction

We're kicking off the subject of Web Apps from Scratch on February 5th, and we're doing it with a personal website that should hold a JSON file with information about yourself and should receive data from an API. This data must be then collected in the second part of this assignment, the team application, in which the collective data of four sites is gathered to make a new website, for the teachers who can then take the students team apps and create something using that data. It's definitely curious and I'm excited to see how it will end up going! For now, let's start at the basics.

## Installation

Here are the steps to install my project.

1. Under the `Code` tab at the top (the big green button).
2. Download this repository as a `.zip` file and unpack it.
3. Locate the folder `web-app-from-scratch-2324.`
   - If you have `VS Code`: From here, all you need to do is open the folder in your editor and use the `Live Server` extension to start a local host. This allows you to also view the code and work more hands-on, should you desire.
   - If not, you can find the document on your device, navigate to the `index.html` file (this should be visible just by opening up `web-app-from-scratch-2324`), right-click it and open in a browser of your choosing: I can recommend Google Chrome, as this is the browser I've used personally.

## Usage and features

This is how you can use my project.

## Checklist / Wishlist

All of these points and, if necessary, possible revisions will be listed and addressed in detail in the next section: [Process](#process).

1 .✅ Draggable master sword

- Possible revision here for accessibility reasons: dragging is difficult on a keyboard.. View reference for this piece of code in the [External Data Sources](#external-data-sources) section.

2. ✅ Music syncing up with the dragging of the sword and the transition to the next 'page' (more on this in point 3).
   - Initially, I had one full audio element, but this became hard to time since I'd need to time it perfectly with a setInterval(). Later on, I ended up splitting this file into two parts: when the first audio stops, the page transitions, and when it does, the next half plays.
3. ✅ Dynamic page loading (considering this is meant to be a one-pager)
   - Using an object, I'm dynamically updating the content of the page depending on certain trigger actions instead of using several HTML pages.
4.

?. ✅ Pop-up for the 'received items'
